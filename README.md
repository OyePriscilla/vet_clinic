# VETERINARY CLINIC
In this project, I use a relational database (SQL) to create the data structure for a vet clinic, create a table to store animals' information, insert some data into it, and query it.

## Getting Started
. [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

To get a local copy up and running, download the zip file or follow the steps below by running these commands in your command line.

~~~bash
git clone git@github.com:OyePriscilla/vet_clinic.git
~~~

Navigate to the location of the folder in your machine:

 ~~~bash
 cd vet_clinic
 ~~~

- For Windows users, Run the following commands in your terminal

1. Login to postgres with your password
2. create your database `createdb <databeName>`
3. Open your postgres terminal `psql`, you should be logged in as
```sql
postgres=#
```
4. Connect to your database.
    ```
    postgres=# \c <databaseName>
    You are now connected to database "<databaseName>" as user "postgres".
    <databaseName>=#
    ```
5. From here you can create tables and manipulate the database.
